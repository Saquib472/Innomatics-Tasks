# Task1 Q3:
# The provided code stub reads two integers from STDIN, a and b. Add code to print three lines where:

a = int(input("Enter the first number:"))
b = int(input("Enter the second number:"))
print("The sum of the two numbers:",a+b)
print("The difference of the two numbers:",a-b)
print("The product of the two numbers:",a*b)
